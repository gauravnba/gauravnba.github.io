## Gaurav Nanda - Game Programmer

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/Gaurav Nanda_FIEA.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>
I'm a game programmer, and closet martial artist, working at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kiddopia.com/">Paper Boat Apps</a>, in Mumbai, India. Here, I make optimised systems that extend the cocos2d-x game engine to make engaging games for children. Before working here, I worked at Universal Orlando, in the Universal Creative division, where I leveraged my software engineering abilities to work on enhancing upcoming attractions for the park.

I studied at and graduated from <a target="_blank" href="https://fiea.ucf.edu/">Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy (FIEA)</a> with a Master's degree in Interactive Media, with a major in Programming. A course made specifically to train the students for the games industry.

I enjoy working as a generalist on game projects with particular focus on gameplay and physics programming. Trying to learn animation and graphics programming currently. I particularly like working in multidisciplinary teams because I have always found good opportunities to grow in that atmosphere, be it in IT or games or even a car garage.

Apart from programming (and games), I play basketball, practice martial arts, lift kettlebells and walk my dog. I also have this weird obsession with coffee and brewing a great cup; but while sticking to manual equipment. Yes, I have three coffee mills, two French Presses, one Aeropress and one South Indian coffee filter, along with a thermometer and scales. No, I do not make pour overs, because I like to keep some things to do the baristas (for now).

Hit me up if you'd like to talk to me about games. Or basketball. Or coffee. Or modern martial arts. Or, like, about a job at your studio.<br>
Or if you'd like to know more about this Lego masterpiece. &#8594;<br>
