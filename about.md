## Gaurav Nanda - Game Programmer

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/Gaurav Nanda_FIEA.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>
I'm a game programmer, and closet martial artist. I recently graduated from <a target="_blank" href="https://fiea.ucf.edu/">Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy (FIEA)</a> with a Master's degree in Interactive Media with a major in Programming.

Before studying at FIEA, I was working in Information Technology services (CRM Middleware) and found that I did not feel satisfied with that kind of software development. I started learning game programming in my spare time and then decided to pursue it academically.

I enjoy working as a generalist on game projects with particular focus on gameplay and physics programming. Trying to learn animation and graphics programming currently. I particularly like working in multidisciplinary teams because I have always found good opportunities to grow in that atmosphere, be it in IT or games or even a car garage.

Apart from programming (and games), I play basketball, practice martial arts and walk my dog.
