## Gaurav Nanda - Game Programmer

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/Gaurav Nanda_FIEA.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>
I'm a game programmer, and closet martial artist. I recently graduated from <a target="_blank" href="https://fiea.ucf.edu/">Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy (FIEA)</a> with a Master's degree in game programming.

Before studying at FIEA, I was working in Information Technology services (CRM Middleware) and found that everyday I felt less of a programmer. So I decided to try game programming on my own time and it seemed to stick. Which is why I pursued it academically.

I enjoy working as a generalist on game projects with particular focus on gameplay and physics programming. Trying to learn animation and graphics programming currently. I particularly enjoy working in multidisciplinary teams because of all the different viewpoints of people that I get to interact with. I have found that I'm still quite young in the industry, so I try to learn from whoever I'm working with and people I hang out with.

Apart from programming (and games), I play basketball, practice martial arts and walk my dog.
