## Gaurav Nanda - Game Programmer

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/Gaurav Nanda_FIEA.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>
I'm a game programmer, and closet martial artist, working at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kiddopia.com/">Paper Boat Apps</a>, in Mumbai, India. I'm here as a missionary of C++. My job is to spread the gospel of modern C++, and how everyone can benefit from a little stack allocation in their lives.

I studied at and graduated from <a target="_blank" href="https://fiea.ucf.edu/">Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy (FIEA)</a> with a Master's degree in Interactive Entertainment, with a major in Programming.

I enjoy working as a generalist on game projects with particular focus on gameplay and physics programming. Trying to learn animation and graphics programming currently. I particularly like working in multidisciplinary teams because I have always found good opportunities to grow in that atmosphere, be it in IT or games or even a car garage.

Apart from programming (and games), I play basketball, practice martial arts, lift kettlebelss and walk my dog. I also have this weird obsession with coffee and brewing a great cup; but while sticking to manual equipment. Yes, I have three coffee mills, two French Presses, one Aeropress and one South Indian coffee filter, along with a thermometer and scales. No, I do not make pour overs, because I like to keep some things to do the baristas (for now).

Hit me up if you'd like to talk to me about coffee. Or basketball. Or games. Or modern martial arts. Or, like, jobs.
Or if you'd like to know more about this Lego masterpiece. &#8594;<br>
