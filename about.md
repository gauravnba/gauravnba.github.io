## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/Gaurav Nanda_FIEA.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

My name is Gaurav Nanda and I'm a game programmer. I like to work as a generalist on game projects. I feel my strong suits are gameplay and physics programming. I am also currently working on teaching myself animation and graphics programming.

I have always been drawn to Engineering. The whole process of figuring out a plan, coming across problems and then fixing them is my jam. As programming games is a field composed of so many different disciplines, it seems to hit the spot just right for me.

Now now, I'm not just a <strike>robot</strike> programmer. I do other things too; like playing sports like basketball. In fact, I'm working with my team to go semi-pro. Oh, and I've been practicing Karate and Tae Kwon Do for almost two decades now. And also been trying to teach myself some grappling by practicing some Jiu Jitsu drills. Pretty badass, I know.
